        <p>An Opamp differentiator performs the opposite action of an integrator: it outputs a voltage proportional to the rate of change of its input.</p>

        <p>The input capacitor sources or sinks a current proportional to the difference between its terminals into the Opamp's inverting input. Since the noninverting input is at ground, this is a virtual ground, and the opamp acts to maintain this by asserting a voltage across R1. This voltage is proportional to the input current, and thus proportional to the rate of change of the input signal. Current flowing through R1 gradually charges C1, ensuring that a DC signal will result in the output of the differentiator returning to ground.</p>
