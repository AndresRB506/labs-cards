        <p>An asynchronous memory module - either temporary like SRAM, or permanent like EEPROM or Flash - can be used to implement arbitrary digital logic functions.</p>

        <p>By simply programming the truth table into the memory, the address lines can be treated as inputs to the binary function, and the data lines can be treated as the result of several independent binary functions. The image depicts a 512x4 memory module, which can implement any four binary functions on 9 inputs.</p>

        <p>In practice, small memory modules like this are difficult to come by; readily availble and cheap memories are more likely to be in the region of 128k x 8 - allowing for an astonishing 8 independent functions of 16 inputs in one IC!</p>
