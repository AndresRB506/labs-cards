        <p>A flyback diode is used to protect electronics from the voltage spikes generated when an inductive load, such as a motor, is disconnected. Cutting power to a motor generates a voltage spike of the opposite polarity, and a flyback diode absorbs this, protecting the driving electronics.</p>

        <p>When a motor or other inductive load is driven unidirectionally, simply connecting a diode in reverse across the motor, as depicted on the left, is sufficient. When a load needs to be driven in either direction, a diode bridge can be formed for each pole of the load, with reverse biased diodes connecting to both supply rails, as shown on the right.</p>
