        <p>An Opamp Integrator performs the mathematical operation of integration on its input signal - that is, its output voltage is proportional to the input voltage over time.</p>

        <p>The resistor R1 converts the input voltage to a current, which charges capacitor C1 at a rate determined by the values of the resistor and capacitor. Since the opamp's noninverting input is at ground, the negative input is a virtual ground, and the opamp acts to maintain that by linearly increasing the voltage on the output while an input signal is present - performing the integration operation.</p>

        <p>The resistor R2 ensures there is gain at DC, preventing offset voltages from building up on the output and causing saturation.</p>
